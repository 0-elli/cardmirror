; Custom NSIS include. electron-builder auto-includes
; ${buildResources}/installer.nsh — i.e. this file — when building the
; NSIS target, and recognizes the customInstall / customUnInstall macros.
;
; TWO jobs live here:
;
; 1. "New > CardMirror Document" in Explorer's right-click menu via the
;    classic ShellNew mechanism: a registry value under .cmir points
;    Explorer at a template file the installer ships (extraResources →
;    $INSTDIR\resources\new-template.cmir; regenerate with
;    `npm run gen:new-template`). The submenu label is the .cmir
;    association's friendly name ("CardMirror Document").
;
; 2. The .docx association, done RIGHT. electron-builder's
;    fileAssociations mechanism (which .docx used through v1.4.0)
;    overwrites the extension's DEFAULT ProgId — and Explorer only
;    shows a ShellNew ("New > …") entry belonging to the CURRENT
;    default ProgId, so stamping ours removed Word's
;    "New > Microsoft Word Document" from the right-click menu on
;    every install and every update (field report 2026-08-26). Worse,
;    the generated class was literally NAMED "Word Document" (the
;    association's display name), and uninstall deleted the class
;    without restoring the default — leaving .docx pointing at a key
;    that no longer exists. So .docx is now registered by hand:
;      - a properly-namespaced class, CardMirror.docx;
;      - listed under .docx\OpenWithProgids ONLY. The extension's
;        default value is NEVER written: CardMirror appears in
;        "Open with" and the Windows default-apps UI, Word keeps its
;        ProgId, its New-menu entry, and its double-click default.
;      - a HEALING pass for machines the old installers broke: if
;        .docx's default still reads "Word Document" (our old class
;        name — Word's real ProgIds are Word.Document.N), restore it
;        to Word.Document.12 when Word is present, else delete the
;        value so Windows re-resolves cleanly. Runs on every
;        install/update, so shipping this fixes affected machines
;        automatically. The user's own double-click choice lives in
;        UserChoice, which this never touches.
;
; SHCTX resolves to HKLM for a per-machine install and HKCU for a
; per-user install, so every write lands in the hive the old installer
; wrote (and broke) for that install mode.
;
; ⚠ Registry work is verified by inspection + a real Windows install
; test; Explorer caches ShellNew and association data, so menu changes
; may need an Explorer restart or sign-out to appear.

/**
 * The collab gate is open everywhere collaboration can exist: every
 * desktop host, and — since the 2026-08-19 soft launch — desktop-layout
 * browser hosts too, no flag required (the old `pmd-collab-web`
 * prototype flip is retired). Closed only where collab can't exist:
 * the mobile shell (co-editing is a desktop-layout feature) and Lite
 * builds (pinned in tests/editor/lite-build.test.ts). Whether collab
 * is ACTIVE stays behind the 'Enable collaboration' master toggle —
 * the gate only decides that the surfaces exist.
 *
 * getHost() caches the resolved host at module scope, so each case
 * resets the module registry and re-imports the gate with the desired
 * `window.electronAPI` presence already in place.
